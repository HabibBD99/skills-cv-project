  My Dear Salam,
  <br/>
  I am Habib. I am a full-stack web developer.
  I have learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for front-end,
  and for back-end I have learned PHP, SQL, and MySQL.
</p>
<p>
  And to secure websites and web-based software, I have learned the popular PHP framework Laravel and the JavaScript framework Vue.js.
</p>

<p>
  Initially, the motivation to learn these came from the W3 School and other websites.
  Later, I completed a three-month course from UI Lab for front-end.
</p>

<p>
  For the back-end, I completed a 6-month certified course in PHP, Laravel, and Vue.js from BITM.
</p>

<p>
  I have learned the graphical user interface framework Electron.js,
  and have built various software using Electron pages.
</p>

<p>
  I am an expert in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, SQL, MySQL.
  I did not focus much on frameworks, because if one knows the core concepts well,
  frameworks naturally become manageable.

<p>Education is a broad process through which a person acquires knowledge, skills, values, behavior, and personality traits. It can be formal, meaning a structured educational system such as schools, colleges, and universities; non-formal, such as training or workshops; or informal, meaning education acquired through everyday life and experience.</p>
<p>Education enables an individual to develop reasoning ability, critical thinking, and the capacity to make correct decisions in life. It assists in socio-economic advancement, employment, and the attainment of personal self-confidence.</p>
<p>At the same time, education does not cripple the related society and culture; rather, it fosters cultural values and a sense of social responsibility, contributing to both individuals and the state in achieving sustainable development and building a democratic society.</p>

       <div class="Edu_Temp_Right">
<p>I completed my HSC “Alim” in the Arts department from a madrasa in 2019.</p>
<p>(“optional”)</p>
<p>
After that, I took admission in the English department at Government Ainuddin College in Faridpur under the National University.
</p>
<p>
I sat for the first-year exam, but unfortunately, even though I passed the exam results, I was ultimately failed. I received a second class. I was failed by paying some money through the board controller.
</p>
<p>The main reason was that in my area, I had many wealthy and powerful enemies. They prevented me from taking the honors course before I even began the honors degree.</p>
<p>Their words were: Why should the son of a poor person do something good? In a place where our sons and daughters can't achieve anything.</p>
<p>
 Subsequently, being unable to find any way out, I left my studies. However, I didn't give up immediately because at one point they began to use black magic and the evil eye against me to destroy me. I saw that many wealthy people were involved, and many established educated people were involved — people I could not stand against.
</p>
<p>I am still trying to get admission into a private university, but I cannot get admission because I am very poor and cannot afford the cost of studying in a private university. Though it would be possible to study in a private university by working in a garment factory in Dhaka, there are people after me even at the garment factory; they intrude and, through the factory in-charge and supervisors, torture me.</p>
<p>These enemies and various companies inside Dhaka essentially keep me within a syndicate; they deploy girls, women, small children after me in order to use the evil eye, and they spit, insult, and abuse me due to black magic.</p>
<p>
 Eventually I had to quit my job. This has been going on for five years; I still cannot gather the money needed to study in a private university.
</p>
<p>
 I even took Fazil in the madrasa line (i.e., enrolled in the Fazil level), but there too I saw that they charge high registration and form-fill fees. From everyone, for four subjects they take 2000-2500 taka; for the poor they take 1400-1500 taka. At my turn, they demanded 5000 taka, but I could only reduce it by 1000 taka; I had 3000 taka. In everything they keep me in the syndicate in such a way that I cannot become educated and achieve something significant.
</p>
<p>
 Even now in this society there are many poor, honest, courageous, innocent young men; they silently endure the oppression of the wealthy, ruthless rulers, and the powerful; they do not even dare to speak anything.
</p>
<p>
 In desperation, I have entrusted my case to the great Allah Ta'ala: what I did not receive in this worldly life, You grant me on the Day of Judgment.

            <h4 class="SubHeadH4">Front-End Designer</h4>  
        </div>
        <div class="Edu_Temp_Right">
<p>
  The <strong>Front-End</strong> refers to the part of web development that is directly visible to users and interacts with them.
</p>
<p>
  Simply put, everything related to a website or application's design, layout, colors, fonts, buttons, menus, etc., falls under the front end.
</p>
<p>
  In front-end development, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are primarily used. These technologies help make a website attractive, engaging, and user-friendly.
</p>
<p>
  Additionally, modern frameworks and libraries like Bootstrap, jQuery, React, Angular, or Vue.js make front-end tasks easier and more efficient.
</p>
<p>
 A skilled front-end developer plays a crucial role in improving user experience (UX) and making a website fast and responsive.

        <div class="Edu_Temp_Left">
            <h4 class="SubHeadH4">Back-End Developer</h4>  
        </div>
        <div class="Edu_Temp_Right">
<p>
  <strong>Back-End</strong> generally refers to that part of a website or software that operates behind the scenes, hidden from the user's view.
</p>
<p>
  The front-end is what we see (UI/UX), while the back-end handles data processing, servers, and database management behind the scenes.
</p>
<h3>Back-End Responsibilities:</h3>
<p>
  The back-end's core responsibilities include server-side logic, database operations, and business processes of a website or application. Although not directly visible to users, it handles tasks like data processing, user authentication (e.g., login), and communication with the server. In coordination with the front-end, the back-end ensures full functionality of a site.
</p>
<p>Database management - storing, updating, and deleting data.</p>
<p>Server-side logic - handling incoming user requests and sending appropriate responses.</p>
<p><strong>Authentication & Security</strong> - managing user login, authorization, and data security.</p>
<p><strong>API Development</strong> - enabling communication with the front-end and other applications.</p>

<h3>Popular Languages and Technologies in Back-End:</h3>
<p><strong>Programming Languages:</strong> PHP (Laravel, Cake), Python (Django, Flask), Java, Node.js, Ruby, C# (.NET)</p>
<p><strong>Databases:</strong> MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Oracle</p>
<p><strong>Servers:</strong> Apache, Nginx</p>
<p>
  Simply put, the back-end is the "brain" of a website or app—where computation and data storage happens.
</p>

<h2>Main Back-End Responsibilities</h2>
<h3>Server-side Programming:</h3>
<p>
  Back-end developers build core logic of a site using server-side languages like PHP, Python, or Java.
</p>
<h3>Database Management:</h3>
<p>
  They handle data collection, storage, and management—crucial for any application.
</p>
<h3>API Creation and Use:</h3>
<p>
  By building APIs (Application Programming Interfaces), the back-end enables data exchange with the front-end.
</p>
<h3>Security and Authentication:</h3>
<p>
  Ensures data security and verifies user credentials.
</p>
<h3>Business Logic:</h3>
<p>
  Manages business processes like order management, inventory, and delivery workflows in the back-end system.
</p>

<h3>Relationship with Front-End</h3>
<p>
  The front-end is what users interact with directly (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). The back-end provides the dynamic data and functionality needed by the front-end.
</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>
  When you order a product in an online store, the back-end system processes the order, handles payment, updates inventory, and initiates the delivery workflow. Though not visible to the user, it's a critical component of the website.

          <h4 class="SubHeadH4">GUI ElectronJs</h4>  
      </div>
      <div class="Edu_Temp_Right">
<h3>History of ElectronJS</h3>
<p>
  Electron was previously known as Atom Shell; it was created to convert GitHub's Atom code editor into a desktop application.
</p>
<p>
  The first release was on July 15, 2013; later the name changed to Electron.
</p>
<p>
  It is built on the Chromium engine and Node.js, allowing creation of cross-platform desktop applications using web technologies (HTML, CSS, JS).
</p>

<h3>Development and Releases</h3>
<p>
  Initially it transitioned from Atom Shell to Electron.
</p>
<p>
  Electron v1.0 was released in 2016; after that focus moved to API stability and improving documentation.
</p>
<p>
  Subsequently, the release cadence aligned with Chromium's release schedule, with weekly or periodic releases.
</p>
<p>
  As of 2025, Electron v36.2.0 has been released.
</p>

<h4>GUI Focus and Usage</h4>
<p>
  To build GUIs, Electron uses a main process and multiple renderer processes. The main process handles the application lifecycle and OS integration, while renderer processes render the UI (HTML/CSS/JS).
</p>
<p>It is cross-platform: works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.</p>

<h3>Popular Application Examples</h3>
<p>Many popular desktop applications are built with Electron, such as:</p>
<p>Visual Studio Code<br>Slack, Discord, etc.</p>

<h3>Summary:</h3>
<p>
  Electron started as Atom Shell in 2013 and evolved into a cross-platform desktop GUI framework built on Chromium and Node.js. Subsequent releases and updates brought robust APIs, regular release cycles, and a large community and ecosystem.

            <h4 class="SubHeadH4">HTML</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="Skills_Temp_Right">
<p>
  <strong>HTML</strong>'s history began in the early 1990s when Tim Berners-Lee created it while working at CERN. Essentially, it started as a markup language for creating and displaying web pages.
</p>
<p>
  Below are some key aspects of HTML's history:
</p>

<h3>Early 1990s:</h3>
<p>Tim Berners-Lee developed HTML while working at CERN.</p>
<p>1991: The first version of HTML was released, marking an important step in the exchange of information on the Internet.</p>

<h3>HTML 1.0:</h3>
<p>This version included some basic markup tags used to define the structure of web pages.</p>

<h4>Later Versions:</h4>
<p>Various versions of HTML were released, such as HTML 2.0, HTML 3.2, HTML 4.0, and the latest version, HTML5.</p>

<h4>HTML5:</h4>
<p>
  This is currently the most widely used version. In this release, many new features were added, including support for audio, video, and graphics.
  The history of HTML is closely tied to the development of web technologies and it has played an essential role in the advancement of the Internet.
</p>

<h3>What HTML is used for</h3>

<p>A website's structure can be built using it.</p>
<p>A software's structure can be built using it.</p>

<h3>Especially in the context of the web</h3>
<p>
  Various HTML tags are used when working with audio and video within a website, creating tables, and building forms.
</p>

<h3>Again, in the context of software</h3>
<p>
  The front-end structure of software is created using HTML—it could be a login form, a registration form, or any needed structure. That structure could belong to web-based software or desktop-based software. In both cases, HTML is required.

        <h4 class="SubHeadH4">CSS</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Skills_Temp_Right">

<p><strong>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</strong> is a style sheet language used to control the presentation and design of web pages. It works with markup languages like HTML or XML to define how a web page should look. According to Wikipedia, CSS is primarily designed for layout, colors, fonts, and other visual elements of web pages.</p>
<h3>Brief History of CSS:</h3>
<p>1994: Håkon Wium Lie first proposed the concept of CSS.</p>
<p>1996: The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) released the first version - CSS1.</p>
<p>1998: CSS2 was released, and work on CSS3 began around that time.</p>
<p>CSS3: It was released in modular form, which differed from previous versions.</p>

<h3>Why CSS is needed:</h3>
<p>
  CSS is essential in both website design and structure.
</p>
<p>
  Previously, websites were designed using only HTML, which made the code complex and harder to maintain.
</p>
<p>
  CSS solves this problem by separating style from HTML, making the code more organized and easier to modify.
</p>
<p>
  According to CSS rules, to change a website's design, one only needs to modify the CSS file, which affects the entire site.

      <h4 class="SubHeadH4">JAVASCRIPT</h4>
  </div>
  <div class="Skills_Temp_Right">

<p><strong>JavaScript</strong> is a programming language primarily used in web browsers to create interactive web pages. It is executed in the browser, can accept user input, and modify webpage elements. It is a client-side scripting language, meaning the browser runs the JavaScript code directly.</p>

<h3>History of JavaScript:</h3>
<p>In 1995, Brendan Eich created JavaScript for the Netscape Navigator browser.</p>
<p>Initially, it was named LiveScript, but later renamed JavaScript to leverage Java's popularity.</p>
<p>In 1996, it first appeared in Netscape 2 browser.</p>
<p>JavaScript was originally designed to make web pages interactive—such as enabling animations, handling user input, and modifying page elements.</p>
<p>Today, JavaScript is one of the world's most popular programming languages and is used on nearly all websites.</p>
<p>It is used not only in browsers but also on server-side and other platforms, such as Node.js.</p>

<h3>Main Features of JavaScript:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Client-side scripting language: runs in web browsers.</li>
  <li>Interactivity: enables animations, user input handling, etc.</li>
  <li>Prototype-based: objects inherit properties from prototypes.</li>
  <li>Object-oriented: supports object-oriented programming.</li>
  <li>Functional programming: supports functional paradigms.</li>
  <li>High-level language: easy to understand for humans.</li>
</ul>
<span>Today, JavaScript is an essential part of web development, and its usage continues to grow.</span>

<h3>What can be done with JavaScript</h3>
<p>As a client-side scripting language, it's used for form validation among other purposes.</p>
<p>It is used to attach various event handlers and present fonts or text elegantly.</p>
<p>It also enables complex animations. JavaScript is used for both front-end and back-end tasks.</p>

<p>On the front-end, developers use Vanilla JavaScript, jQuery, Angular, React to build web pages or software, working with DOM and BOM specifically.</p>
<p>On the back-end, JavaScript is used with Node.js and often with databases like SQLite.</p>
<p>JavaScript can also be used to create desktop applications via GUI frameworks like Electron.js.</p>

<p><strong>PHP</strong> is a popular server-side scripting language mainly used for web development. It was created in 1994 by Rasmus Lerdorf. Initially, it was known as “Personal Home Page/Tools” (PHP/FI), developed to track visitors on his personal website. It later gained recognition as a powerful web development language.</p>

<h3>Early History</h3>
<p>In 1994, Danish programmer Rasmus Lerdorf created some CGI scripts on his personal website for visitor tracking.</p>
<p>Initially, it was called “Personal Home Page Tools (PHP Tools)”.</p>

<h3>Development Path</h3>
